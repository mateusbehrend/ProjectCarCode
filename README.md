# ProjectCarCode
 This folder contins the arduino code for a self-driving car project. The project contains the original tracking code and has two sub folders that contain two faster versions of the code. The car makes use of sensor fusion to be able to track a black line. The car was able to handle curves, small discontinuities, and turn arounds. The car also used encoder counts to be able to adjust speeds and sensitivity at certain junctions along the way.
